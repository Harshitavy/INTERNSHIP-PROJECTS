AI/ML Internship Contribution
This repository contains my AI/ML contributions to InternPe, where i did my internship. My contributions include:
 # Project 1
Diabetes Prediction using ML. In this task , a diabetes csv file is used as a dataset provided by the company Officials. We predict whether the patient is diabetic or not using python and predict the accuracy of the SVM algorithm.
# Project 2 
CAR PRICE Predictor with ML-  In this task, A car csv file is used as a dataset provided by the company officials. Here we study the dataset file using Python and predict the car price using ML algorithms.
# Project 3
IPL WINNING TEAM PREDICTION - In this task, Two csv files are used as a dataset provided by the company officials. Here we study the dataset file using Python and predict the Winning IPL Team using ML algorithms.
# Project 4
BREAST CANCER DETECTION - In this task, A csv files is used as a dataset provided by the company officials. Here we study the dataset file using Python and predict the Breast Cancer using ML algorithms. Here we use the sklearn, a python library and load the data from sklearn.
